# -- Summary -- #
In this chapter we took a look at some new widgets, QPushButton, QLineEdit, QCheckBok, and QMessageBox class. It is important to use dialog boxes in your program when you want the user to collect inforamtion outside of the application or to delay important details to the user. But you also should not have a dialog box popup for ever little nuance or with very little helpful information.
	The applications in this chapter are by non means complete. there are the framework to get you start making your own GUIs. For example you could make sure that the user's password includes capital and lowcase letters and other characters to make it more safe. Another possibility is to let the user know if the username they want to create already exists. Once you learn how to implement menus, you could even have the user search through their files or for a profile image. I encourage you to try implements some of there ideas or even you ideas.
